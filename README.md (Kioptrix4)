enum4linux result

After running enum4linux I found 3 username:


[+] Enumerating users using SID S-1-22-1 and logon username '', password ''

I tried SQL Injection Auth bypass with both username and password. I found that password field is vulnerable to SQLi. So, I tried with those usernames that I found from smb enumeration.

Found only worked with username john,robert with this payload into password field:

username - john

payload - john' OR 1=1 -- -

username - robert

payload - robert' OR 1=1 -- -

Found juicy credential

Member's Control Panel
Username 	: 	john

Gain User Access

I tried login into ssh with username john and password as MyNameIsJohn:

Priv Escaltion with mysql

After running linpeas.sh, I found that we can login into mysql as root without password.

and also found:

╔══════════╣ Searching mysql credentials and exec

I tried sys_eval('id'); But it didn't work so I tried another command exec:

use mysql;

Congratulations!
You've got root.

There is more then one way to get root on this system. Try and find them.
I've only tested two (2) methods, but it doesn't mean there aren't more.
As always there's an easy way, and a not so easy way to pop this box.
Look for other methods to get root privileges other than running an exploit.

It took a while to make this. For one it's not as easy as it may look, and
also work and family life are my priorities. Hobbies are low on my list.
Really hope you enjoyed this one.

If you haven't already, check out the other VMs available on:

Thanks for playing,
